# La Porta d'Acqua v2 - Angular

This is the frontend of the second version of [laportadacqua.com](https://laportadacqua.com).

It's written in Angular (v17+).

I'm going to use some libraries:
- Tailwind
- TaigaUi
- @angular/localize
- (probably) @angular/material

Using node `v20.10.0` and npm `10.2.3`

# Preferences and Settings

Preferences and Settings are the same thing.

The only difference is that Preferences are user-specific settings, while Settings are application-wide settings.
